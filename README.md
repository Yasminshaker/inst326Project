# inst326Project

The purpose of our app is to help students study vocabulary words, by enabling them to create a flashcard study program that can be used to be create, organize, and used for studying by using a user input feature. Users can store flashcards in local CSV files, import additional flashcards via an API, and track their progress as they study.
